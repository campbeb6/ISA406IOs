# RedhawkQuad
  This project is for an autonomous drone contest.  This repository will document the software for the drone project.
  
  The drone consists of a 3dr quadcopter kit, an ardupilot flight controller, a rasberry pi microprocessor, and an arduino    microprocessor. Signals are sent wirelessly to the arduino in order to control the flight of the drone based on what the        various sensors are reading. The rasberry pi sends signals to the flight controller.
