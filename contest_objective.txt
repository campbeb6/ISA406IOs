The drone competition objective is described 
as this by flyaavc.org:

Build a fully autonomous quadrotor that will navigate
through a GPS-denied, hazard-cluttered indoor 
environment to search for a target. Take a picture of the 
target and geolocate a distinct point on it. Wirelessly 
transmit a picture of the target to a ground station.
Determine the location and location uncertainty of the 
target within a local coordinate system and report the 
results to the ground station.
